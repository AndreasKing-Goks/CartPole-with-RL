# CartPole-with-RL
This repository is created for PhD mini project 1.

This project aims to learn the learning mechanism of a reinforcement learning agent in a Cart Pole environment. The environment class is made with the Gymnasium API Cart Pole environment as a reference. But the dynamics of the cart pole is written manually based on this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6313077

This learning goal is to maintain the pole "straight" between in a predetermined pole angle boundary, while also maintaining the position of the cart pole between the pre-determined position threshold. The learning method used in this project is a simple Q-Learning state-action value estimation method.
